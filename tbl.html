    <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
    <h2><a id="Bio" name="Bio">Biography</a></h2>
    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. </p>
    <p>He is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>),
      a Web standards organization founded in 1994 which develops interoperable
      technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the
      Web to its full potential. He is a Director of the <a href="http://www.webfoundation.org/">World
        Wide Web Foundation</a> which was launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts
      to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity. </p>
    <p>A graduate of Oxford University, Sir Tim invented the Web while at <a href="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>,
      the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web
      client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were
      refined as Web technology spread.</p>
    <p>He is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of
      Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical
      Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science
      and Artificial Intelligence ( <a href="http://csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>)
      at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>)
      where he co-leads the <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/">Decentralized
        Information Group (DIG)</a>. <br />
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu">Decentralized Information Group</a>,
      works on the <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com">Solid Project</a> to give
      people control of their own data and to re-decentralize the Web. He is the
      co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://inrupt.com">inrupt</a>, the
      company launched to ensure the success of the Solid platform and its open
      source community, and to build the ecosystem that supports it.<br />
    </p>
    <p>He is also a Professor in the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-10-27-sir-tim-berners-lee-joins-oxfords-department-computer-science">Computer
        Science Department at the University of Oxford</a>, UK. He is President
      of and founded the <a href="https://theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>
      in London. In 2011 he was named to the Board of Trustees of the <a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford
        Foundation</a>, a globally oriented private foundation with the mission
      of advancing human welfare. He is President of London's <a href="https://www.odi.org/">Open
        Data Institute</a>. </p>
    <p>In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He has been the
      recipient of several international awards including the Japan Prize, the
      Prince of Asturias Foundation Prize, the Millennium Technology Prize and
      Germany's Die Quadriga award. In 2004 he was knighted by H.M. Queen
      Elizabeth and in 2007 he was awarded the Order of Merit. In 2009 he was
      elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He is the
      author of "<a href="Weaving/Overview.html">Weaving the Web</a>".</p>
    <p>On March 18 2013, Sir Tim, along with Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn, Louis
      Pouzin and Marc Andreesen, was awarded the <a href="http://qeprize.org">Queen
        Elizabeth Prize for Engineering</a> for "ground-breaking innovation in
      engineering that has been of global benefit to humanity."</p>
    <p>Sir Tim has promoted open government data globally and spend time
      fighting for rights such as net neutrality, privacy and the openness of
      the Web. <br />
    </p>
    <p>On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded theÂ <a href="http://awards.acm.org/about/2016-turing"
        title="turing prize">ACM A.M. Turing Prize</a> for inventing the World
      Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and
      algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Turing Prize, called the "Nobel
      Prize of Computing" is considered one of the most prestigious awards in
      Computer Science. <br />

    <h2><a id="Before" name="Before">Before you mail me</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you need someone to find something for you about some arbitrary
        subject (travel agents, or parakeets or whatever), don't ask me, but try
        the <a href="http://vlib.org/">Virtual Library</a> for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a>
        or your favorite search engine.</li>
      <li>If you want to know how to run a server, or how to edit HTML, check
        the <a href="/">W3C web</a> or your local bookstore. I'm sorry I can't
        answer individual requests for help.</li>
      <li>If you can't access something on <tt>www.w3.org</tt> , you find bad
        links from www.w3.org pages, or errors in the hypertext please see the <a
          href="../../Help/Webmaster.html">webmaster's documentation</a>..</li>
      <li>If you are doing homework or a school project on the history of the
        Web then please check my <a href="Kids.html">Kid's questions</a>, or
        the more general <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>; and
        also, <a href="/Help/">W3C FAQ</a>, or <a href="FAQ.html">my press FAQ</a>
        as almost everything I have is there or linked from this page. I am
        sorry I cannot help with individual projects.</li>
      <li>If you are a member of the press and need clarification or an
        interview, please mail <a href="mailto:w3t-pr@w3.org">w3t-pr@w3.org</a>
        (and Cc me) with details.</li>
      <li>If it is about a possible speaking engagement, see <a href="#Speaking">below</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have a serious comment on things I have signed, then do email me.
      I am also always open to discussion with W3C Advisory Committee
      representatives.</p>
    <h2>What not to email</h2>
    <p>Email is safe unless it contains programs. (Data and documents are fine,
      programs are not). If you send me a program, I will not run it, as it
      could damage my system and could be a virus.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Note: Documents for Microsoft word, Excel, and possibly other Office
        programs tend to execute programs (scripts) in what you would expect to
        be harmless documents. These can expose my machine to viruses, because
        these programs do not (it seems) prevent scripts from running within a
        document when it is received by email. Please do not send me Microsoft
        Office documents.</li>
      <li>If you are sending text, please send it as plain text, HTML, or PDF.
        If you use your favorite word process, slide tool, etc, and send it in
        that program's format, then you are forcing me install proprietary
        software on whatever machine I read them on.</li>
      <!--
      <li>If your email is sent from Microsoft Outlook, and contains an attachment,      I will be more likely to discard it as I understand that a famous series of      viruses in 2001 resulted from Outlook's tendency to execute scripts in      email, and used up a huge amount of my and my colleague's time.</li>      -->
    </ul>
    <h2>What you can email</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These are all good document standards: Plain text messages, HTML
        (sometimes called rich text) pages without scripts, Photos (JPEG files,
        PNG, GIF and SVG), PDF, SMIL, RDF/XML, N3 and so on. All these can be
        sent as messages or as attachments to messages. I can read them with a
        variety of software programs, and they cannot contain viruses, unless
        there is a serious bug in the code I use to read them. If you don't need
        anything else, then use plain text.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are good rules when emailing anyone.</p>
    <p>Please use my full name in the "To" line with my email address, as this
      will make your message look less like spam. This will happen automatically
      if you have me in your address book. If you just type in my email address,
      I probably won't see your mail.</p>
