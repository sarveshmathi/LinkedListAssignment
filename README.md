# LinkedListAssignment

In this assignment we worked with LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues to deepen our understanding of these three fundamental data structures.

For complete details on this project refer to **Assignment Part1.pdf** and **Assignment Part2.pdf**.

**Learning Objectives**

* Become familiar with the functionality and implementation of a LinkedList
* Apply what you have learned about how LinkedLists store data
* Develop algorithms for modifying LinkedList content
* Become familiar with the methods in the java.util.Stack class and java.util.Queue interface
* Work with an abstract data type (specifically, queues) by using only the interface of an implementation
* Apply what you have learned about how stacks and queues work
